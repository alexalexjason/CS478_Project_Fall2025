HONS 129 for Summer 2026 (1 Credit)
Roots and Wings: Native Plants, Pollinators, and
Sustainable Landscapes
Taught by Dr. Edie Hardcastle, Biology – Wednesday, 9:00 am – 11:50 am
This summer course introduces students to the
identification, cultivation, and ecological value of native
plants, with special attention to their role in
supporting pollinators. Students will learn in both
classroom and outdoor settings, practicing plant
identification, engaging in native plant
installation and care, and participating in invasive
plant management. The course highlights how land
management choices, including pesticide use, shape
pollinator health and biodiversity. 
Learning Outcomes

1. Identify common native and invasive plant species in southern Indiana.
2. Explain the ecological value of native plants for pollinators and ecosystems.
3. Learn methods of planting and maintaining native species.
